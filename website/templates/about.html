            <p>Holiday helper started off as a personal project with the aim of helping people decide on the best
                place to travel based on a vague idea of the holiday they are looking for!
            </p>
            <h4>When using the app, please remember the following:</h4>

                and whilst the goal is to help you as much as possible, we recommend checking locations <strong>thoroughly</strong>
                before committing to the destination.

                    Quick note, this is still a small project in very early stages, and our
                    main goal is to build an app that actually helps users.
                    We only ask for your name, email, and password so that you can create and use your account.
                    Your password is always stored securely and never in plain text.
                    We don’t track you or collect anything else. Your info is only used to make the app work.
                    If you have any questions about your data,
                    you can reach us via <a href="mailto:support@holidays-helper.com">support@holidays-helper.com</a>
